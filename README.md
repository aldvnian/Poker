# Poker
This is a custom made Texas Hold'em Poker game. The User Interface is text-based and there are certain small tweaks to the original specification of the game.

Tweaks:
1. Multiple players can be added, the set value is 3.
2. There are no big blinds and small blinds, a single player is chosen to play a blind based
   on the round of the game and it rotates throughout the players.
3. Player chosen to play the blind gets their turn last.
4. Every round, winner is decided based on hand rankings purely.
5. Winning players with the same hand ranking receive the prize evenly distributed.
